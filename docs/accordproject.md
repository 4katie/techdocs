## What is the Accord Project?

Accord Project is an open source, non-profit, initiative aimed at transforming contract management and contract automation by digitizing contracts.

Accord Project defines a notion of a legal template with associated computing logic which is expressive, open-source, and portable. Accord Project templates are similar to a clause or contract template in any document format, but they can be read, interpreted, and run by a computer.

The goal of the Accord Project is to provide a common, standardized format for smart legal contracts.
